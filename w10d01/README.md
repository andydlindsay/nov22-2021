### To Do
- [x] "Rails Week" Conversation
- [x] MVC Review
- [x] Quickly build simple Rails app
- [x] Nested Resources

### Rails Convo
* enjoyed that it did a lot for you (made assumptions)
* rails is cool!
* convention vs config feels nice
* no semicolon
* do more with less code
* didn't like do and end (vs brackets)
* syntactic sugar was nice
* generate is handy
* struggled with class assignment when using form_for
* like the terminal output
* errors weren't as anxiety inducing
* nested curly braces in alligator clips
* naming files
* modifying the database (ActiveRecord)
* docs aren't too bad

### MVC Review
* Model - responsible for talking to db (User.all)
* View - responsible for creating a webpage based on inputs
* Controller - brains of the operation
