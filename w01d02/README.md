# W01D02 - The Dev Workflow

### To Do
- [x] Curriculum overview
- [x] Example problem workflow
- [x] Problem solving tips
- [ ] Review git workflow

### Curriculum
* 1 && 2: Fundamentals FOCAL
* 3: TinyApp Server-side (back end)
* 4: Tweeter Client-side (front end)
* 5: Data persistence (database)
* 6: Midterm group project (2-3)

### The Problem
Write a program that takes in an unlimited number of command line arguments and prints out the sum of them. If any argument is not a whole number, skip it. Do not support negative numbers.







Falsey
0
''
null
NaN
undefined
false

[]
{}


```js
condition ? doIfTrue : doIfFalse
```

### Refactoring
* changing the code, but not the output
